          <h3>Identifying Medical Microagressions</h3>
          <h6>Branding, Interactive</h6>
          <p>
            The Truth and Reconciliation Commission's article #18 demands the
            implementation of healthcare rights free of discrimination to
            Indigenous peoples. In response, this campaign identifies medical
            microaggressions, explains their colonial legacies, and provides
            steps toward taking accountability.
          </p>
